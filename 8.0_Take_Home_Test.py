HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________

For every section of code predict what you think it will do and record it. Next, test it
and record what it actually did. It's not a problem if you were wrong.
Make sure you understand WHY it prints what it does.
You don't have to explain it, but if you don't understand why, make sure to ask.
Otherwise you are wasting your time doing these.

'''
13.)
Write a program that takes a list like the following, and prints the average. 
Use the len function, don't just use 15, because that won't work if the list size changes.
(There is a sum function I haven't told you about. 
Don't use that. Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter.) 
(Also, a common mistake is to calculate the average each time through the loop 
to add the numbers. Finish adding the numbers before you divide.)
